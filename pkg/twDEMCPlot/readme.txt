R package Template

Copy this folder to start a new R-package.
Rename the copy of the folder to the name of your package.


directories:
------------
R:	all reusable R functions

data: all the data provided with the package (maybe used by examples)
src: C or Fortran level code (mkdir only when supplying code, empty dir causes problems)
tests: code executed on package installation. 
man: documentation (will be generated by inlinedocs)
inst/genData: R code that produced the data and Rd documentation files of the data
inst/unitTests: Functions that check your code (see package RUnit)

all other things should go to directory inst 

_genPackage.R
-------------
code to maintain the package (to be pasted into RGui)


Adaptation of the template
--------------------------
* adjust the entries in file DESCRIPTION, 

* adjust the package name 
** i.e. replace templatePackage by the name of your package, which must correspond to the name of the root folder 
** in tests/doRUnit.R 
** in _genPackage.R

* put your functions to subdirectory R and other code to inst.

Examples contained in the Template
----------------------------------
* 2 functions in R/soilResp.R
* 2 unit tests corresponding to the functions in inst/unitTests/*.R
* one example dataset, which is generated and documented inst/genData
